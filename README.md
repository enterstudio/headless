# Headless

Headless is a web 3.0 framework for managing Internet connected devices and scripting anything you can imagine with JavaScript.


## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - >=0.10.0, essentially anywhere you can get Node working you can run Headless, embedded computers, NAS and TV devices.
1. Visit [https://headless.io/setup/](https://headless.io/setup/) with [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

```sh
curl -sL https://github.com/pschroen/headless/archive/stable.tar.gz | tar -zxv
cd headless-stable
npm install
npm start
```

Return to the setup page, create your first user and happy scripting! :)
