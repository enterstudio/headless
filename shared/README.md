# Headless

Headless is a web 3.0 framework for managing Internet connected devices and scripting anything you can imagine with JavaScript.


## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - >=0.10.0, essentially anywhere you can get Node working you can run Headless, embedded computers, NAS and TV devices.
1. Visit [https://headless.io/setup/](https://headless.io/setup/) with [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

```sh
curl -sL https://github.com/pschroen/headless/archive/stable.tar.gz | tar -zxv
cd headless-stable
npm install
npm start
```

Return to the setup page, create your first user and happy scripting! :)


## Slack integration

Headless was created specifically for developing webhooks to devices, and with that it's perfectly suited for creating public webhooks you can use in your own Slack projects. If you've created a Slack integration with Headless that you want to share, feel free to open a pull request to contribute to the list here.
